First we need to understand the basics of regression and what parameters of the equation are changed when using a specific model.Visualization of the squared error (from Setosa.io)
The equation for this model is referred to as the cost function and is a way to find the optimal error by minimizing and measuring it.Visualization of the squared error (from Setosa.io)
The equation for this model is referred to as the cost function and is a way to find the optimal error by minimizing and measuring it.The gradient descent algorithm is used to find the optimal cost function by going over a number of iterations.The gradient descent algorithm is used to find the optimal cost function by going over a number of iterations.The gradient descent algorithm is used to find the optimal cost function by going over a number of iterations.The gradient descent algorithm is used to find the optimal cost function by going over a number of iterations.But the data we need to define and analyze is not always so easy to characterize with the base OLS model.Equation for least ordinary squares
One situation is the data showing multi-collinearity, this is when predictor variables are correlated to each other and to the response variable.To produce a more accurate model of complex data we can add a penalty term to the OLS equation.To produce a more accurate model of complex data we can add a penalty term to the OLS equation.These are known as L1 regularization(Lasso regression) and L2 regularization(ridge regression).The best model we can hope to come up with minimizes both the bias and the variance:
Ridge regression uses L2 regularization which adds the following penalty term to the OLS equation.These are known as L1 regularization(Lasso regression) and L2 regularization(ridge regression).The best model we can hope to come up with minimizes both the bias and the variance:
Ridge regression uses L2 regularization which adds the following penalty term to the OLS equation.L2 regularization penalty term
The L2 term is equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients.is zero then the equation is the basic OLS but if it is greater than zero then we add a constraint to the coefficients.Here we perform a cross validation and take a peek at the lambda value corresponding to the lowest prediction error before fitting the data to the model and viewing the coefficients.= 1 denotes lasso)
Performing Elastic Net regression
Performing Elastic Net requires us to tune parameters to identify the best alpha and lambda values and for this we need to use the caret package.We will tune the model by iterating over a number of alpha and lambda pairs and we can see which pair has the lowest associated error.We will tune the model by iterating over a number of alpha and lambda pairs and we can see which pair has the lowest associated error.We can see that the R mean-squared values using all three models were very close to each other, but both did marginally perform better than ridge regression (Lasso having done best).First we need to understand the basics of regression and what parameters of the equation are changed when using a specific model.Visualization of the squared error (from Setosa.io)
